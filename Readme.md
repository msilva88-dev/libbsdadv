libbsdadv provides BSD libc compatibility functions
whose original licenses include the BSD 4-Clause (“advertising”) requirement.

This library is separated for policy and licensing reasons and is intended
for optional use where the advertising clause is acceptable.
It is maintained independently from libbsdcompat
to allow clear license boundaries and flexible system integration.
